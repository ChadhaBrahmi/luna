# BackStory
Luna was a cat my little sister rescued one day , she had been hiding under a car tire, and the driver was about to drive off so she could’ve been seriously hurt or worst , but my sister screamed and  made a scene so the driver stopped  just in time saving her life.
She brought her home, and we took care of her from then on , Sadly, she passed away last summer, just five months after we had her /:
I’d grown really attached to her, since she was always there to keep me company while I worked or studied /:
